Hello!

Our working group created an initial round of Schema.org markup for legal aid groups in Spring 2020. 

This markup is now out of date. We advise you not to use these as guides for your markup.

Instead, use markup from Round 2 in this repository. We have improved the markup standard to be more of a 'Graph' with multiple entities rather than sub-descriptions of a single engity.
